"Nike ?? my favorite brand not only shoes , it has an excellent athletic products that i have been using ."
We love Nike in our house. And 100% support their campaign. My son wears Nike almost everyday. The quality of the clothes and shoes are outstanding. They last for a really long time. The airwick material drys fast. While it is a bit pricey but in this case you pay for what you get. I just recently bought a Nike bathing suit and its amazing. Very high quality compared to most bathing suits and its super cute. I would highly recommend. And will be buying again.
I like nike I really do however sometimes I feel like the quality has gone down some. I dont like to feel as if I'm just paying for a name I actually want good quality clothes if I'm spending a lot of money. Some shirts that I have just dont last and the shoes also seem to get run down quick. Their kids clothes seem to fair a lot better
"Amo sus maletas, mochilas, tenis, short. Aunque sea deportivo, combina muy bien con algo casual ????"

Nike's quality is consistent. I have worn their running shoe the Pegasus for 6 years now and every new pair is always amazing.
"I love nike products, I bought a pair of running shorts that lasted me for almost 3 years and they've been my favorite comfy shorts for a while. I also love getting hats and sports bras because of how good the quality is. I recommend Nike brand 100%"
Nike is usually one of the top brands I tend to gravitate to when it comes to athletic and leisure clothing. They are always made with the best quality and always right on trend. I also really love that I can always find a great range in pricing.

Nike is classic. Everyone has something Nike in their home or they have in the past. I like their sneakers and so does my husband. Even if their politics are not ideal for some people i am not about drama or getting into politics so i will continue to buy their sneskers if i see a pair that i happen to like.

I was the first of them who run the first opened Nike story in Georgia Batumi . Without any reason i love Nike. Just do it
"Nothing more comfortable than the clothing for exercise and is that when training is important to be known to finish satisfactorily training, I love the line of shoes, socks and obviously clothes is my favorite of all time the quality of your fabrics It is incredible they last a lot of time I recommend them."
I like Nike there reasonably priced good quality and very comfortable and you can find worms that at just for your everyday needs
I love the material that Nike has to offer they have every sport in their brand I love it
Nike has always been the only brand of tennis shoes I have never worn they have and all white high-top sneaker that I fell in love with 20-plus years ago! Believe or not all white high tops and I mean all White are next to impossible to find but Nike has them and Nike sneakers are and always have been top quality sneakers!
"I have always loved Nike, the quality is always something you can count on with this brand and you will definitely love their shoes. They are just the most comfortable ever. I have had many pairs of their shoes and I only threw them away when I completely destroyed them by walking on them everyday! 8/10 would recommend."
"Nike has always had my heart and I love how minimalistic their clothing is. I’ve had a few tops and leggings from them that are always the most comfortable items in my closet. I could live in them forever. I wish they were that expensive so I could continue to always buy from them but the few I have are enough to feed my crave for Nike. Don’t even get me started on the shoes. Best running shoes, 10/10 recommend."
I love nikes trainers! They are great for the gym or everyday wear! Although some are quite expensive they are worth it as they last a long time and are good quality. I will be shopping there again..
"Nike gear is trully great. The fit is incredible and I consider it to be one of the top brands in sports gears not only because of the name. I use nike gear almost daily, am a huge fan of the compression shorts and the long ones. The material is very comfortable and the incredible durability of nike products I believe is what separates them from the rest."
"Me facina las zapatillas  y los diseños sobre todo la comodidad son muy buenos se los recomiendo demaciado mi impresion hacia la marca me encanto, como te atienden son muy amables y compraria definitavamente otra vez lo sugiero ;) "
"Nike shoes are literally the best all around active type shoe. There are tons of options and varieties ranging from golf shoes to work boots to casual everyday wear shoes. Check them out, you won’t be disappointed!"

"Nike is our all time go to brand as we have several pairs of shoes for each of us, pants Nike pro shorts, sports bras, sweatshirts, you name it we probably have it. It’s durable and comfortable."
"Súper cómodo y lindo, buena calidad y tiene muchas opciones de estilo para cada ocasión"
"In love Nike, everything they have from clothing to shoes I buy it all. I've been a loyal Nike customer since I was a kid and don't plan on stopping anytime soon."
Nike has never let me down! Their shoes are phenomenal with great support! When you walk a lot or plan to be on your feet for long periods of time I highly suggest investing in a good quality tennis shoe. I have multiple pairs that I’ve had for years and the quality is still there.
"They are light and so comfortable. When I was a retail manager, I had to be on my feet 10 hours a day. Only shoe I never had to break in."
Love it has nice shoes and also clothes my favorite purchase were some nike leggings
Nike makes the best sport/workout items. I love their clothes especially their leggings. I can run and they always stay up. Their shoes are very comfortable and last a long time. Nike is a bit pricey but your paying for the high quality items so its worth it.
"Other than one other brand, Nike is the only tennis shoe I wear. They are so comfortable. No matter what the shoe is for, from work out to casual. Some of the shoes tend to get a bit on the pricey side but they have very affordable shoes also."
"Nike is classic. They have a ton of great products, shoes and clothing. It's awesome that they have great styles that are very versatile and great for more then just sports and fitness fanatics. I'm sure everyone can find a style from nike that they love."
they’re products are usually okay. they don’t hold up as well as they used to. the shoes seem to fall apart in about six months. the clothes last longer but you the color fades over time. i would shop some where for cheaper first
I think Nike is a great store obviously they can do a few changes. There still a good company. A lot of my friends use Nike like everyday. It makes other people was to try it. So I think they should keep doing what there doing and there going to great success!
"The Nike Outlet stores always have a sale or  good deal going on! I always find something for me and my husband when I go in! The sales people are always helpful, but they don’t follow you around. And their return policy is ???? If their shoes come apart they’ve always given us money towards a new pair or exchanged them! "
Recently bought Nike sneakers and I love them! They’re so comfortable and they were a good price too! Always has sales no matter what time of the year you go! Very good products as well. Definitely will continue to shop here!
"Love Nike trainers, always well made and long lasting. Great for kids trainers too, my son loves them."
They’re expensive but worth it. Good quality shoes and clothing. They’re not obnoxious with their labels like some name brands can be.
"I love nike products. My cleats are beautiful and nice. My hoodie is really comfortable and warm. The quality of nike is really good, especially since the price is not even that high."
"Not a big fan of their unethical labour practices. The quality is questionable depending on the product, colour variations are usually black and white or shades of grey unless you’re buying dunks or Jordan’s. Women’s clothing is very predictable, boring, and usually always has something pink involved."
"I mostly use it to buy sneakers for me and my boyfriend who change them very often. They are comfortable, good quality and beautiful designs."
Love the Nike brand very much. Very high quality for the pricey tag. Will continue to repurchase. Very comfortable and true to normal sizing and fit. Would recommend. ???? very popular brand and is discounted at Marshalls
I like Nike because I love run and a good sneaker is important to me! And I use that shoes and I don't have pain on my feet after or during my training period.

I have 4 of the same pair of Nike tennis shoes because they are the only shoes I can wear that offer flexibility and arch support for HIIT trainings.
"Love Nike, most of my shoes are from them. Always fashionable, cute, and most of all comfortable. My feet hurt really easily and I can walk for hours in Nike's without major feet pain. Their clothes are also very cute and good quality. Stores in malls are usually much more expensive than outlets (stores have newer and popular things, but outlet items are just as good quality). "
I really like Nike their clothes are very comfortable their shoes are very comfortable and if you go to the Nike outlet you’re going to get a really good deal
I do love Nike. I uses to not like them until I tried in a pair of their nike knit fit shoes and let me tell you... they’re my favorite shoes. They’re so comfy. They fit like socks. They match all my little workout outfits and they’re just so damn adorable. I hope they never stop making them.
"I run a lot, so workout clothes is important to me. The leggings stay up and don’t fall down when I run, which is one of my main things I look for when I buy leggings. There are many styles that is for everyone. I would recommend this brand to anyone"
Nike is only ok. The quality of their merchandise has really gone down hill in the last 20 years. Crappy quality for double the price??? No thanks. 
This brand is one of a kind ! The quality is amazing and Kind of expensive but worth it
"Love their trainers, very comfortable, a little bit expensive but worth the money, as if looked after properly they last a long time"
I love the Nike product I never have to worry about them falling apart I wouldn’t improve nothing. I like the products I purchase from there I am a repeat user and suggest this to anybody to buy
Obsessed with Nike. It’s the only place I’ll buy running shoes from!!! Always have new super cute styles and they last FOREVER.
"Buy running shoes way too often from here, but would never purchase anywhere else. I like to buy the last year's model. Every year the shoes get better and better, lighter and lighter. Love my Nike running shoes and will always buy them. So comfortable!"
"All the Nike items are fabulous, I love the shoes are very comfortable and durable, the clothes are great because it helps me to move without feeling uncomfortable, the whole line of women's clothing is great, I love it and I always tell my friends that Use them because they are amazing"
"Great products, a little pricey but it’s amazing. It’s one of the stores I shop at a lot. It would be nice if there were smaller sizes! ??????"
"I have been a repeat customer of Nike. I love my super comfy, lightweight running shoes, my high top Jordans and Air Force 1’s. I gave a star off because they are a bit pricey but hey its Nike."
"Nike shoes are very comfortable! I really like them, and they are pretty affordable, too! I have bought their lifestyle and running shoes for a couple years now, and every pair I have gotten has worked out for me! I would recommend this store."
Love the sneakers but they are so dang expensive. Most of my Nike sneakers really last though so I don’t totally mind the price
"The ONLY trainer brand I own. Comfortable, stylish and always creating new styles. Even with Nike ID such a good touch to personalise items. Pros - comfort and style. Cons - can be quite expensive especially if buying trainers regularly"
"Nike is my favourite sports brand and I shop here very often. The most I like shoes Nike AirMax 90, Roshe One, Kaishi. The quality was Perfect, now it is a Little bit poorer but comparing to other brands still very Good."
I have always been a big Nike customer but now I’m not excited to get a product but now I’m also proud of my purchase. To support a company that stands for freedom. Nike has always been top of the charts. But this moment they have created a whole new level of success. They have been making big money moves. I recommend buying stock!
"I love all the variety of Nike products, I feel they are a bit more expensive but I still purchase shoes the most"
Love their sneakers.. they not only look great but are super comfortable to wear to the gym or work since my job is pretty active .
"I’ve always been a fan of this brand, specially their shoes & workout wear. I recommend it"
Love Nike one of my favorite sports brands really dear but worth it not a big fan of there new trainers thought would rather their old air max some of the clothes and shoes are really expensive and ain’t even nice
"Love the shoe fit and the design is great, but for the price I paid I think they could be made with a better quality. My shoes only last 1 year and I only wear them while working out, never for a random day."
"Nike ?????? my favorite brand for life, I love clothes but especially my favorite Nike tennis shoes and it's the brand I grew up with, good quality and good prices!"
Always my favourite sport shoe brand when I'm looking for a great quality product for the amount of wear and tear I put my exercise apparel through.
Absolutely love Nike! They have really nice products! Its very affordable! They have the best shoes and active wear.
Amazing quality of athletic wear. You can really buy anything even if you don’t workout or play sports. It’s very comfortable and breathable if you do workout/play sports. It’s a fitness brand my closet is full of!
Go to store for shoes and workout apparel! Clothing always lasts longer than other brands.
They always come out with the cutest work out gear hands down! It is pricey and not always the best quality but who doesn’t want to rep Nike Gear. I get excited every time i get new Nike Gear.
Oooh girl i love everything they have. My wardrobe is full of Nike. It is not very expensive but the quality great
I have a sneaker obsession. Always choose NIKE to get my sneakers and I literally wear my black classic pair Everyday
